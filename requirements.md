# Backend Feature Requirements - ALX-Airbnb Clone

This document outlines the essential technical and non-functional requirements for the backend development of the ALX-Airbnb clone project. These requirements guide the architecture, implementation, and overall quality assurance of the system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

### 1. Database Management
-   **Database System**: Utilize a relational database such as `PostgreSQL` or `MySQL` for data persistence.
-   **Required Tables**: The database schema must include the following core tables to manage application data:
    -   `Users` (to store information for guests, hosts, and admins)
    -   `Properties`
    -   `Bookings`
    -   `Reviews`
    -   `Payments`

### 2. API Development
-   **API Style**: Implement `RESTful APIs` to expose backend functionalities to the frontend application.
-   **HTTP Methods**: Ensure proper usage of standard HTTP methods and status codes for:
    -   `GET` (retrieve data)
    -   `POST` (create data)
    -   `PUT/PATCH` (update data)
    -   `DELETE` (remove data)
-   **GraphQL (Optional but Recommended)**: Consider integrating `GraphQL` for scenarios requiring complex data fetching and optimized query capabilities.

### 3. Authentication and Authorization
-   **Authentication**: Implement `JWT` (JSON Web Tokens) for secure and stateless user sessions.
-   **Authorization**: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage permissions based on user roles:
    -   `Guests`
    -   `Hosts`
    -   `Admins`

### 4. File Storage (Scenario-Based)
-   **Cloud Storage**: Store property images and user profile photos using cloud storage solutions such as `AWS S3` or `Cloudinary`.
-   **Implementation Note**: For current implementation purposes, file storage will be utilized.

### 5. Third-Party Services
-   **Email Notifications**: Integrate with reliable email services like `SendGrid` or `Mailgun` for sending email notifications (e.g., booking confirmations, password resets).

### 6. Error Handling and Logging
-   **Global Error Handling**: Implement a centralized mechanism for handling API errors consistently across the application.
-   **Logging**: Establish a robust logging system to capture application events, errors, and debugging information.

## üöÄ Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Scalability
-   **Modular Architecture**: Design the backend with a modular and loosely coupled architecture to facilitate easy scaling and and maintenance.
-   **Horizontal Scaling**: Enable the application to scale horizontally by deploying multiple instances behind load balancers to handle increased traffic.

### 2. Security
-   **Data Encryption**: Secure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) both at rest and in transit using appropriate encryption techniques.
-   **Threat Prevention**: Implement security measures such as firewalls and rate limiting to protect against malicious activities, including DDoS attacks and brute-force attempts.

### 3. Performance Optimization
-   **Caching**: Utilize caching tools like `Redis` to improve response times for frequently accessed or computationally intensive data (e.g., property search results).
-   **Database Query Optimization**: Optimize database queries and indexing to minimize server load and reduce data retrieval times.

### 4. Testing
-   **Unit and Integration Tests**: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests using frameworks like `pytest` to ensure individual components and their interactions function correctly.
-   **Automated API Testing**: Develop automated tests for API endpoints to verify functionality, performance, and adherence to specifications.
